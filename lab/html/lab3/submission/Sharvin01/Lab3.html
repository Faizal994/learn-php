        LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has
        mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.

    </p>

    <p>

        According to the report, sections of the documents— "<i>almost invariably the most crucial passages</i>"—are
        marred by an
        indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that
        began at
        the agency's inception in 1947.

        CIA Director<b>Porter Goss</b> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of
        several
        historic events, such as:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>the Cold War</li>
        <li>the civil-rights movement</li>
        <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>

    </ul>

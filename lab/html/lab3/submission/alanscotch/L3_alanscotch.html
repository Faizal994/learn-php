    <p>
        LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has
        mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.
    </p>

    <p>
        According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred by
        an
        indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that
        began at
        the agency's inception in 1947.
    </p>

    <p>
        CIA Director <b>Porter Goss</b> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of
        several
        historic events, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> the Cold War</li>
        <li> the civil-rights movement</li>
        <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
    </ul>

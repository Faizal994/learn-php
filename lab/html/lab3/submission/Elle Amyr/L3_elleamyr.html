    <p>LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has
        mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.
    </p>

    <p>According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred by
        an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that
        began at the agency's inception in 1947.
    </p>

    <p>CIA Director <strong>Porter Goss</strong> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars
        of several historic events, such as:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>The Cold War</li>
        <li>The civil-rights movement</li>
        <li>The growth of the international drug trade</li>
    </ul>

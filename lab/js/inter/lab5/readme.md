> For the JavaScript code used in this lab exercise, you must create a script.js file. A sidebar on the right side of the interface contains the logo image, name, and some navigation links (Figure 17.1). Furthermore, at the left - bottom, there is a fascinating section "Dark Mode" with a toggle button (Figure 17.2). When you click on that toggle button, the interface of this admin panel changes to dark mode. On the left side, there is a sidebar toggle button that allows you to open or close that sidebar (Figure 17.3). Also included are a search box and data summaries.

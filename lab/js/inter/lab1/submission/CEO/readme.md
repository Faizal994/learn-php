### 1. How to create this website?
> Step 1: Set Up the Project

Create a new folder for the project.
Save the provided HTML code in a file named "index.html".
Create a new folder named "images" and save the necessary images in it.
Save the provided CSS code in a file named "style.css" and place it in the same folder as the HTML file.
Create a new JavaScript file named "script.js" and place it in the same folder as the HTML file.

Replace the sample text in each section (Home, About, Skills, Services, Contact) with your own content, including text, images, and icons.
Customize the navigation links and the "href" attributes to point to the corresponding sections in the HTML file.

> Step 4: Styling

Customize the styles in the "style.css" file to match your desired appearance. Adjust colors, fonts, spacing, and layout as needed.

> Step 5: JavaScript Functionality

Customize the JavaScript code in "script.js" to add any interactivity or dynamic behavior required for your website. For example, you can implement smooth scrolling when clicking on navigation links.

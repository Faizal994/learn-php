# Lab 3: Coming soon landing page

When you‚Äôre introducing a new website or a product, there are often several aspects that need to fall into place before you could even end up making it publicly available. Leaving your website empty, whether you have vague plans for the future, is not really a SMART option for your customers. Rather, put a bit more effort towards developing a creatively enticing Coming Soon page that covers your pre-launch marketing as well as notifies your customers of your forthcoming presence.

A coming soon page can be a valuable asset to have during these glacial periods, not just as a stopgap for your forthcoming store or product. Moreover, these pre-launch marketing pages, if used properly, can help you achieve exposure, gather feedback, and begin marketing as you strategize before your public launch.

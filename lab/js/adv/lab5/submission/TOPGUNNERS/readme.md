Explain how dictionaryapi works:
-The dictionaryapi used in this project is a RESTful API (dictionaryapi.dev) that provides access to various dictionaries and their word definitions. It follows the client-server architecture, where the client (the Dictionary App in this case) sends a GET request to the API server, specifying the word to be searched as a parameter in the URL. The server processes the request, retrieves the relevant word data from its database or external sources, and sends the response back to the client in a structured format, typically JSON.


Where can I find a list of available dictionaries?
-The specific list of available dictionaries supported by the dictionaryapi.dev can be found on their website or API documentation. You can visit the official website of dictionaryapi.dev or refer to their documentation to get details about the available dictionaries and their features.


Please repair the voice until it is audible:
-As an AI text-based model, I don't have access to the specific code or context of the "voice" feature in the Dictionary App. However, to repair the voice until it is audible, you can check the implementation of the voice feature in the JavaScript code of the app. Ensure that the necessary steps are taken to retrieve the correct voice data and properly utilize the text-to-speech functionality provided by the browser's Speech Synthesis API. Additionally, make sure that the necessary audio output settings on the user's device are configured correctly to ensure the voice is audible.

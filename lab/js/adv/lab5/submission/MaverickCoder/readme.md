# Lab 5: Dictionary App

Activity üèÜ :
## Q1: Explain how dictionaryapi works.
Ans:
1. API Registration: Developers typically need to sign up for an API key or access token from the provider offering the dictionary API. This key is used to authenticate and authorize their requests to the API.

2. Endpoint and Request: The API provider usually exposes specific endpoints or URLs that developers can use to make requests. For example, there could be an endpoint like https://api.dictionary.com/definitions to fetch word definitions. Developers construct HTTP requests to access the desired data, specifying the necessary parameters such as the word they want to look up.

3. Authentication: To authenticate the request, developers include their API key or access token in the request headers or as a query parameter. This helps the API provider identify and validate the user making the request.

4. Response: After receiving the request, the API processes it and generates a response. The response is typically in a structured format like JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or XML (eXtensible Markup Language). It contains the requested information such as word definitions, synonyms, part of speech, example sentences, pronunciation, etc.

5. Parsing and Integration: Developers can parse the response data using programming languages and libraries. They extract the relevant information and integrate it into their applications, websites, or any other software they are building. This allows them to display word definitions, implement search functionalities, or create language-related features.

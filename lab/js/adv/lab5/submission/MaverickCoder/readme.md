# Lab 5: Dictionary App

Activity üèÜ :
## Q1: Explain how dictionaryapi works.
Ans:
A dictionary API is a programming interface that allows developers to interact with a dictionary or a lexicon database programmatically. It typically provides a set of methods or endpoints that developers can use to retrieve word definitions, synonyms, antonyms, translations, pronunciations, and other linguistic information.

API Endpoint: The dictionaryapi has a specific endpoint URL that developers can use to send HTTP requests and retrieve word information. In the provided code, the API endpoint is constructed using the following URL format:  let url = `https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/${word}`;, where {word} is the word to be searched.

Making Requests: To fetch word information from the API, developers need to make an HTTP request to the API endpoint. In the code, the fetch function is used to make a GET request to the API endpoint with the word appended to the URL.

Response Format: The dictionaryapi responds with data in a specific format, typically JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). JSON is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for machines to parse and generate. It represents structured data as key-value pairs.

## Q2: Where can I find a list of available dictionaries?
Ans:
Merriam-Webster Dictionary API: Merriam-Webster provides a Dictionary API that offers access to their extensive dictionary database, including word definitions, synonyms, antonyms, pronunciations, and more. You can find more information and access their API documentation on their developer portal: https://dictionaryapi.com/

Oxford Dictionaries API: Oxford Dictionaries offers an API that provides access to their vast collection of dictionaries, including English, Spanish, French, and more. Their API offers various endpoints for word lookups, translations, and other language-related information. You can find more details on their developer website: https://developer.

jQuery UI Autocomplete: If you're looking for a JavaScript library to provide autocomplete functionality based on existing dictionaries, you can consider using jQuery UI Autocomplete. It allows you to implement a search input field with suggestions based on a predefined list of words or a remote data source. You can find the documentation and examples on the jQuery UI website: https://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/

# Lab 10: QR Code Generator

Activity üèÜ :
## Q1: How are QR codes generated?
Ans: 

1. Include the library
2. Create a container element
3. Generate the QR code
4. Display the QR code

## Q2: QR should be resized to 300x300.
Ans:
To resize the generated QR code to a specific size, such as 300x300 pixels, you can modify the width and height properties in the QR code generation code. 


## Q3: What data is sent to the Api Server?
Ans:

Text: The most common use case is to encode plain text within the QR code. This text can be sent as a parameter or payload in the API request.

URL: QR codes often contain URLs that direct the user to a specific website or web page. The URL extracted from the QR code is usually sent as part of the API request.

Structured Data: QR codes can also encode structured data, such as contact information (vCard format), event details (iCalendar format), or Wi-Fi network configurations. The extracted structured data is typically formatted and sent to the API server accordingly.

Custom Formats: QR codes can be used for proprietary or custom data formats specific to an application or business. In such cases, the decoded data is parsed and formatted appropriately before being sent to the API server.


## Q4: What is the function of a wrapper?
Ans:
a wrapper is a construct that encapsulates or wraps around an existing entity or functionality to provide a different or enhanced interface or behavior. The primary function of a wrapper is to add an additional layer of abstraction, control, or functionality to the wrapped object or code.

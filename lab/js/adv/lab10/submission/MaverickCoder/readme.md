# Lab 10: QR Code Generator

Activity üèÜ :
## Q1: How are QR codes generated?
Ans:
1. Data Selection: Determine the type of data you want to encode in the QR code. This can include URLs, text, contact information, Wi-Fi network details, and more.

2. Encoding: Convert the selected data into a format that can be represented by a QR code. This typically involves using specific algorithms and encoding schemes such as alphanumeric, numeric, or binary.

3. Error Correction: QR codes incorporate error correction techniques to ensure reliable scanning even if the code is partially damaged or obscured. Error correction adds redundant information to the QR code, allowing for the reconstruction of the original data even if parts of the code are unreadable.

4. QR Code Structure: QR codes have a specific structure that includes various components like timing patterns, alignment patterns, and positioning patterns. These components help scanners locate and decode the QR code accurately.

5. Symbol Generation: The encoded data is converted into a matrix of black and white squares, known as modules, that form the QR code symbol. Each module represents a bit of information.

6. Module Alignment: The modules are arranged and aligned based on the QR code structure. This ensures that the QR code can be easily scanned from different angles and orientations.

7. Quiet Zone: A quiet zone, which is a blank margin around the QR code, is added to provide sufficient space and contrast for scanners to detect and decode the code correctly.

8. QR Code Rendering: The final QR code image is generated by rendering the modules, quiet zone, and other necessary components. The image can be in various formats, such as PNG, JPEG, or SVG.

## Q2: QR should be resized to 300x300.
Ans:
Modify the width and height properties in the style.css as below

.qr-code img{
  width: 300px;
  height: 300px
}

## Q3: What data is sent to the Api Server?
Ans:
1. Content: The content of the QR code, such as a URL, text, contact information, Wi-Fi network details, or other data. This content is typically provided as a parameter or payload in the API request.

2. Size and Error Correction Level: The desired size and error correction level of the QR code. This information may be included as parameters in the API request to specify the dimensions and level of redundancy required.

3. Encoding Format: The format or encoding scheme for the data to be encoded in the QR code. For example, alphanumeric, numeric, binary, or specific data formats like vCard or calendar events. The API may provide options or parameters to specify the desired encoding format.

4. Output Format: The desired format of the generated QR code image. This can include formats such as PNG, JPEG, SVG, or PDF. The API may provide options or parameters to specify the output format.

5. API Authentication: If the QR code generation API requires authentication or usage limits, the request may include authentication credentials such as an API key or access token to authorize the user and track usage.

## Q4: What is the function of a wrapper?
Ans:
A wrapper allows you to apply CSS styles and define layout properties to a group of elements as a single unit. By applying styles to the wrapper, you can control the appearance, positioning, and spacing of the wrapped elements.

Wrappers also help in organizing and structuring the content of a webpage. They provide a logical grouping of elements, making it easier to understand and manage the structure of the webpage's layout.

# Lab 8: A Weather App

Activity 🏆 :
## Q1: Provide weather information for the cities of Longyearbyen and Novosibirsk..
Ans: 

Longyearbyen, Svalbard, Norway:

Temperature: The current temperature in Longyearbyen is typically cold due to its location in the Arctic. It can range from -10°C to -20°C (14°F to -4°F) in winter and around 0°C to 5°C (32°F to 41°F) in summer.
Weather conditions: Longyearbyen experiences long, cold winters with a lot of snowfall. Summers are relatively short and cool. The area is known for its polar night, where the sun does not rise above the horizon for several months in winter, and the midnight sun during the summer months.
Novosibirsk, Russia:

Temperature: Novosibirsk experiences a continental climate with distinct seasons. In winter, temperatures can drop to -20°C to -30°C (-4°F to -22°F), while in summer, they can reach 20°C to 30°C (68°F to 86°F).
Weather conditions: Winters in Novosibirsk are cold and snowy, while summers are warm and can be quite hot. Spring and autumn are transitional seasons with milder temperatures. The city experiences a moderate amount of rainfall throughout the year.

## Q2: Demonstrate how to use device location.
Ans:

HTML Markup: Create an HTML structure that includes elements for displaying the weather information, such as temperature, weather description, and location.
JavaScript: Write JavaScript code to handle the location retrieval and fetch weather data using an API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API). You can use the device's geolocation to get the latitude and longitude and then make a request to the weather API using those coordinates.
CSS (Optional): Apply CSS styles to the HTML elements to improve the visual appearance of the weather information.

Testing: Open the web page in a browser that supports geolocation. The app will request permission to access the device's location. Once permission is granted, the app will retrieve the latitude and longitude and make a request to the weather API. The received weather data will then be displayed on the web page.


## Q3: What is the openweathermap API?
Ans:

Current Weather: Real-time weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, and more for a specific location.

Forecasts: Weather forecasts for a given location, including hourly and daily forecasts for several days ahead. These forecasts include details like temperature, precipitation, wind, and more.

Historical Weather Data: Historical weather information for a particular location, allowing you to retrieve weather data from past dates.

Weather Maps: OpenWeatherMap provides various weather maps that can be integrated into applications, including maps for temperature, precipitation, wind, clouds, and more.

Weather Alerts: Notifications for severe weather conditions such as storms, hurricanes, and other significant weather events.

## Q4: What exactly is the purpose of weatherDetails?
Ans:
The purpose of the "weatherDetails" variable or object would be to store and organize the specific weather-related data that you need for your application or code. By accessing the properties within "weatherDetails", you can retrieve and utilize the specific weather details to perform various operations or display the information to users.

## Q3: Please use the Twitter icon to post a quote. Explain what happened and how it happened?
Ans: In the JavaScript code, you retrieve the text content of the quote element and use it to construct the URL for the Twitter intent. The encodeURIComponent() function ensures that any special characters in the quote are properly encoded for the URL. Finally, the window.open() function is called to open the Twitter intent URL in a new window or tab, allowing the user to post the quote on their Twitter account.

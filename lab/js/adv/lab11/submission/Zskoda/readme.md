## Q1: What are the functions of question.js and script.js?
Ans:
Without additional context, it's difficult to provide specific information about "question.js" and "script.js" as these filenames are quite generic and could be used in various contexts. However, I can give you a general idea of what these files might typically contain based on common practices in web development.

question.js:

This file could potentially be associated with a web page or application that involves question-and-answer functionality.
It might contain JavaScript code that handles the logic for presenting questions, processing user responses, and managing the overall question-and-answer flow.
Depending on the specific implementation, it could include functions for validating answers, tracking user progress, retrieving questions from a server, or displaying results.
script.js:

"script.js" is a commonly used name for a JavaScript file in web development, where it is used to encapsulate and organize custom JavaScript code for a webpage or application.
It typically contains JavaScript functions and code that provide interactivity and behavior to the elements on a webpage.
The specific functions and purpose of "script.js" can vary widely depending on the webpage or application it is associated with.
It may include event handlers, AJAX requests, DOM manipulation, form validation, animation, or other functionalities needed to enhance the user experience.
It's important to note that the actual content and functionality of these files can vary greatly depending on the project, development practices, and the intentions of the developers.

## Q2: Try adding quiz questions to the list of ten questions.
Ans:

we start with an existing array quizQuestions that contains ten pre-defined quiz questions. The addQuizQuestion() function allows you to add new questions to the array. You can call this function with the question and answer parameters to add new quiz questions dynamically.

In the example, two additional questions are added using addQuizQuestion(). You can add as many questions as you want by calling the function with the appropriate question and answer values. We display the updated quizQuestions array using console.log() to verify that the new questions have been added successfully.

## Q3: How to change Response Time to 30 Seconds.
Ans:

1. Adjust Server-Side Code
2. Configure Server or Proxy
3. Use Network Throttling
4. Consult Server Administration or Hosting Provider

## Q4: Where are the scores saved?
Ans:

1. Database
   
## Q5: What happens when you click the Quiz replay button?
Ans:

When you click the "Quiz replay" button, the exact behavior or action taken depends on the implementation of the quiz application or webpage. Generally, the "Quiz replay" button is designed to allow the user to restart or play the quiz again from the beginning. 

## Q6: What are the css/all.min.css files for?
Ans:
The "css/all.min.css" file is typically associated with the Font Awesome library, which is a popular icon set and toolkit for web developers.

Font Awesome provides a collection of scalable vector icons that can be easily customized and styled using CSS. The "all.min.css" file is a compressed and minified version of the CSS file that contains all the necessary styles for rendering and displaying the Font Awesome icons.

By including the "css/all.min.css" file in your web project, you gain access to a wide range of icons that can be easily incorporated into your HTML markup. You can then apply various CSS classes and styles to these icons to achieve the desired appearance and behavior.

## Q2: Try adding quiz questions to the list of ten questions.
Ans:

we start with an existing array quizQuestions that contains ten pre-defined quiz questions. The addQuizQuestion() function allows you to add new questions to the array. You can call this function with the question and answer parameters to add new quiz questions dynamically.

In the example, two additional questions are added using addQuizQuestion(). You can add as many questions as you want by calling the function with the appropriate question and answer values.

Finally, we display the updated quizQuestions array using console.log() to verify that the new questions have been added successfully.

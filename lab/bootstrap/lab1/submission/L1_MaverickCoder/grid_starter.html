                A kitten (also known as a kitty or kitty cat) is a juvenile cat.
                After being born, kittens are totally dependent on their mother
                for survival and they do not normally open their eyes until
                after seven to ten days. After about two weeks, kittens quickly
                develop and begin to explore the world outside the nest. After a
                further three to four weeks, they begin to eat solid food and
                grow adult teeth. Domestic kittens are highly social animals and
                enjoy human companionship.

                A puppy is a juvenile dog. Some puppies can weigh 1–3 lb
                (0.45–1.36 kg), while larger ones can weigh up to 15–23 lb
                (6.8–10.4 kg). All healthy puppies grow quickly after birth. A
                puppy's coat color may change as the puppy grows older, as is
                commonly seen in breeds such as the Yorkshire Terrier. In
                vernacular English, puppy refers specifically to dogs while pup
                may often be used for other mammals such as seals, giraffes,
                guinea pigs, or even rats.

                Rabbits are small mammals in the family Leporidae of the order
                Lagomorpha, found in several parts of the world. There are eight
                different genera in the family classified as rabbits, including
                the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), cottontail rabbits
                (genus Sylvilagus; 13 species), and the Amami rabbit (Pentalagus
                furnessi, an endangered species on Amami Ōshima, Japan). There
                are many other species of rabbit, and these, along with pikas
                and hares, make up the order Lagomorpha. The male is called a
                buck and the female is a doe; a young rabbit is a kitten or kit.

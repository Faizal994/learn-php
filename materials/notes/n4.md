# PHP Fundamentals

PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used scripting language designed for web development. It is primarily used to create dynamic web pages and server-side applications. PHP is known for its simplicity, flexibility, and extensive support for interacting with databases and various web technologies.

## Basic Syntax

PHP code is typically embedded within HTML code, enclosed between `<?php` and `?>` tags. It can also be used within standalone PHP files with a `.php` extension.

Here's an example of a basic PHP script that displays "Hello, World!" on a web page:

```php
<?php
    echo "Hello, World!";
?>
```

In the above code:

- The `<?php` tag denotes the beginning of PHP code.
- The `echo` statement is used to output the specified text.
- The text "Hello, World!" is enclosed within double quotes.
- The `?>` tag marks the end of PHP code.


## 1. Syntax and Variables

- PHP code is embedded within HTML using opening and closing tags: `<?php ... ?>`.
- Variables in PHP start with the `$` sign and are case-sensitive.
- Variable values can be assigned using the assignment operator (`=`).
- PHP supports different data types, such as strings, integers, floats, booleans, arrays, and objects.

Example:

```php
<?php
$name = "John Doe";
$age = 25;
$isStudent = true;

echo "Name: " . $name . "<br>";
echo "Age: " . $age . "<br>";
echo "Is Student: " . $isStudent . "<br>";
?>
```
In the above code:

- The `$name` variable stores the string "John".
- The `$age` variable stores the integer value 25.
- The `.` operator is used for concatenation.
- The `<br>` tag inserts a line break in HTML.

## 2. Control Structures

- PHP provides control structures like `if...else`, `switch`, `while`, `for`, `foreach`, etc., for implementing conditional and looping logic.
- Conditional statements allow you to perform different actions based on different conditions.
- Looping statements help you iterate over arrays, perform actions repeatedly, and control the flow of code execution.

Example:


```php
<?php
    $score = 80;

    if ($score >= 90) {
        echo "Excellent!";
    } elseif ($score >= 75) {
        echo "Good!";
    } else {
        echo "Keep it up!";
    }
?>
```

In the above code:

- The `$score` variable is set to 80.
- The `if` statement checks if the score is greater than or equal to 90 and displays "Excellent!" if true.
- The `else if` statement checks if the score is greater than or equal to 75 and displays "Good!" if true.
- If none of the above conditions are met, the `else` block is executed, displaying "Keep it up!".


## 3. Functions

- PHP allows you to define and use functions to group related code and reuse it throughout the program.
- Functions can have parameters and return values.
- You can create both built-in functions and user-defined functions.

Example:

```php
<?php
function calculateSum($num1, $num2) {
    $sum = $num1 + $num2;
    return $sum;
}

$result = calculateSum(5, 7);
echo "Sum: " . $result;
?>
```

## 4. Arrays

- Arrays in PHP can store multiple values in a single variable.
- PHP supports indexed arrays, associative arrays, and multidimensional arrays.
- Arrays can be accessed, modified, and manipulated using various array functions.

Example:

```php
<?php
$fruits = array("Apple", "Banana", "Orange");

echo "First fruit: " . $fruits[0] . "<br>";

$student = array(
    "name" => "John Doe",
    "age" => 20,
    "grade" => "A"
);

echo "Student name: " . $student["name"] . "<br>";

$numbers = array(2, 4, 6, 8, 10);

echo "Count: " . count($numbers) . "<br>";
?>
```

## 5. File Handling

- PHP provides functions for reading from and writing to files on the server.
- You can open, close, read, write, and manipulate files using PHP's file handling functions.

Example:

```php
<?php
$file = fopen("example.txt", "w");
fwrite($file, "Hello, World!");
fclose($file);

$file = fopen("example.txt", "r");
$data = fread($file, filesize("example.txt"));
fclose($file);

echo $data;
?>
```

These are some of the fundamental concepts of PHP. With these foundations, you can start building dynamic web applications using PHP.

Note: Ensure that you have a web server with PHP installed to run PHP code.

Remember to save the code examples with a `.php` extension and run them on a web server to see the output.

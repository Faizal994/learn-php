# JavaScript: Fundamentals

JavaScript is a widely-used programming language that is primarily used for creating interactive web pages. It provides the ability to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites, such as form validation, animations, and interactivity. Here are some fundamental concepts of JavaScript:

## Variables

Variables are used to store and manipulate data in JavaScript. You can declare variables using the `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords.

```javascript
// Declaring a variable
var name = "John";

// Changing the value of a variable
name = "Jane";

// Declaring a constant
const pi = 3.14;
```

## Data Types

JavaScript has several built-in data types, including:

- **String**: Represents a sequence of characters.
- **Number**: Represents numeric values.
- **Boolean**: Represents either `true` or `false`.
- **Array**: Represents an ordered list of values.
- **Object**: Represents a collection of key-value pairs.
- **Null**: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
- **Undefined**: Represents an uninitialized variable.

```javascript
// Examples of data types
var name = "John";
var age = 25;
var isStudent = true;
var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
var person = { name: "John", age: 25 };
var emptyValue = null;
var undefinedValue;
```

## Operators

JavaScript supports various operators for performing arithmetic, assignment, comparison, and logical operations.

```javascript
// Arithmetic operators
var sum = 5 + 3;
var difference = 10 - 5;
var product = 2 * 4;
var quotient = 10 / 2;
var remainder = 10 % 3;

// Assignment operators
var x = 5;
x += 2; // equivalent to x = x + 2

// Comparison operators
var isEqual = 5 === 5;
var isNotEqual = 5 !== 3;
var greaterThan = 10 > 5;
var lessThan = 3 < 7;

// Logical operators
var logicalAnd = true && false;
var logicalOr = true || false;
var logicalNot = !true;
```

## Conditional Statements

Conditional statements allow you to perform different actions based on different conditions.

```javascript
var age = 18;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are eligible to vote.");
} else {
  console.log("You are not eligible to vote yet.");
}
```

## Loops

Loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code.

```javascript
// While loop
var i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}

// For loop
for (var j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
  console.log(j);
}
```

These are just a few fundamental concepts of JavaScript. The language offers many more features and functionalities for building dynamic web applications.

> Note: The code examples provided here assume the usage of JavaScript in a browser environment, where the `console.log` function is used to print output to the console. In other environments, such as Node.js, the `console.log` statement may differ.
